      If you have a legal concern about the content of etreedb.org, <b>please
      read this page first</b>.  You can then contact us using the link
      below.<br><br><br>
      
      <b>THERE IS NO MUSIC OR VIDEO AT etreedb.org</b>.<br><br>  We
      are not a
      download site.<br>  We are not a file-sharing service. <br> We are not a
      peer to
      peer service or a bittorrent tracker.  <br>You cannot download anything
      here
      except for text files. <br><br> <b>THERE IS NO MUSIC OR VIDEO AT
      etreedb.org</b>.<br>
      
      <p><u>What is etreedb.org</u>? etreedb.org does three things.
      <u>First</u>, we provide a database of
      performance information:  who played what, when and where.  <u>Second</u>, we
      are a database of meta-data about lossless audio recordings
      of bands like the Grateful Dead, Phish and many others, who permit
      their fans to record and/or freely exchange their live
      performances.  <u>Third</u>, we provide a mechanism for users to link these
      performances and recordings to personalized lists. </p> <br>
      
      <li>Some people think that the
      performances and recordings listed here can be downloaded from
      etreedb.org.  That is untrue.
      <b>THERE IS NO MUSIC OR VIDEO AT etreedb.org</b>. </li><br>
      
      <li>If you are a copyright holder, you have an obligation to make a reasonable
      and diligent investigation of the facts before claiming that we are
      violating your copyright.  That investigation will show that we aren't
      violating your copyright.
      <b>THERE IS NO MUSIC OR VIDEO AT etreedb.org</b></li><br>
      
      <li>We are occasionally contacted about material on other websites that
      are linked from etreedb.org.   For example, <a href =
      "http://www.archive.org/audio/">the Live Music Archive</a> has audio
      files that can be downloaded.  Similarly, <a href =
      "http://bt.etree.org">bt.etree.org</a> tracks BitTorrent sessions.
      Both sites contain legal material only, and
      comply with artists' taping/trading policies.  If they make a mistake,
      please contact them directly.  We cannot remove content from other
      people's websites.
      <b>THERE IS NO MUSIC OR VIDEO AT etreedb.org</b></li><br>
      
      <li>From time to time, artists' policies change.  There can
      confusion about the contours of an
      artist's trading policy.  Occasionally, material is mis-listed here (or
      on another site linked from db.etree) as being one thing when it is in
      fact something else.  This usually happens by mistake, and can be easily
      corrected.  Please let us know, and we will investigate and
      make whatever changes are appropriate.</li><br>
      
      <li>If you want us to remove performance listings from etreedb.org, we
      probably won't.   That's like asking a library to remove
      newspapers from the shelves because you don't like what they say.
      If, however, you find an inaccuracy in the
      performance data, we are anxious to correct it.  Indeed, you can do so
      by clicking the edit link on each performance listing.  You do not need
      to contact us to make a correction.  Just go ahead and do it.</li><br>
      
      <li>We are occasionally threatened with legal action because a user's
      list refers to material that may not be lawfully copied.  If you believe
      that a etreedb.org site user is infringing your copyright, please begin by
      contacting that user directly.  In our experience, the most common
      problem is ignorance, and asking nicely works wonders.</li><br>
      
      <li>We also provide a mechanism for users to distinguish between
      material that may, and that may not, be lawfully traded.  Therefore, please
      do not ask us to intervene in a private dispute with a user of this
      site.  We cannot enter people's homes and confiscate their
      possessions.  Even if we could, we wouldn't.</li><br>
      
      <b>A final word to performers and their lawyers</b>:<br>
      
        We are not your
      enemy.  Please take the time to learn about what we do.  If you still
      have concerns, use this opportunity to reach us by e-mail.  We
      will gladly address your concerns if we can.  <br><br>
      
      In a database this large, mistakes are inevitable.
      They can usually be corrected.  Your misplaced hostility will not help.  Nor
      will an  inconsiderate and inaccurate cease and desist letter.
      
      If you are a lawyer, you will suffer the
      embarrassment of explaining to your client that you made a mistake.
      And, we who practice law take our our ethical responsibilities seriously.
      We trust that you do, too.  Attorneys:  please review
      <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/LegacyPDFS/rules/jointappellate/NY-Rules-Prof-Conduct-1200.pdf">
      the New York Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly Rules 1.1(a), 1.3(a), 1.14 and 2.1</a>, or your
      jurisdiction's equivalent.  <br><br>
